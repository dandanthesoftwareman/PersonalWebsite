      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Daniel Schuler. I'm a born-and-raised Michigander currently
        residing in Potterville, MI. I have been a musican since I picked up a
        bass at 14; because I've stuck to playing it I've been able to travel
        across the mitten to see the beauty of the state, playing shows all
        along the way. I love camping, hiking, finding good restaurants, a good
        craft beer, and working with my hands. When I'm not coding I'm generally
        doing house projects or out playing music with my friends.

        Like I said, I've been a musician since I was 14. I started pursing a
        career in music after my first paid performance and in 2020 it became my
        fulltime job. I currently play in my original band

        and with a wedding band organization called the

          >Bluewater Kings Band</a
        >. I also play various concerts with local Michigan-based artists when
        they need a bass player. I have also worked in recording studios,
        engineered for churches, built studio spaces, and given lessons as a
        part of working in the music industry.

        I made a transition to developing after a long winter season without
        gigs to play. I started to look into lines of work that would still
        allow me to play shows and tour. After ruling out jobs that required the
        skills I already had such as construction, electronics repair, painting,
        and clerical work, I turned to an old journal where I had written out a
        list of things I wanted to eventually learn in life. Somewhere on that
        list was "learn to program a computer". Next thing I knew I was asking
        anyone I knew that worked in the tech field about their job and what it
        was like to work it. My roomate at the time was a Grand Circus alumnus
        who helped talk me through my first few basic programs, I applied to the
        C# .Net bootcamp, and the rest is history.
